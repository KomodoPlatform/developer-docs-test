Clone repo to local dir

`git submodule --init --recursive`

Build the Antara Gaming SDK in submodules dir

Run the Doxygen XML file builder for Gaming SDK

Run the build process for Doxybook2 in the submodules dir

Make sure the /docs root directory has latest version of the recent KomodoPlatform/developer-docs repository version

If needed (optional), make any changes to template files in /doxy/templates directory

Run the command (currently located in TODO.txt file) to make Doxybook2 import xml files and create markdown versions of the files

In the /doxy directory create a build directory

In the /doxy directory execute: `cmake -B ./build .` to build files

cd into /doxy/build/my_src/ directory, run the ./komodo-doxybook2 file

This imports all markdown files from Doxybook2, compacts them into smaller files, saves them into the /docs/... directory,
and then writes the Gaming SDK sidebar content for the file structure/configuration

Push the resulting changes to master, and this should trigger the rebuild process, allowing the docs to go live.

The idea is for this to be implemented on a test site
